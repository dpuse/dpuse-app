The DPUse browser application.

## About DPUse

DPUse (Data Positioning & Use) is an in-browser application that positions your data for use through three core activities: sourcing, contextualising, and publishing.

**Sourcing** uses a library of [Connectors](https://www.dpuse.app/connectors) to establish [Connections](https://www.dpuse.app) to applications, databases, file stores, and curated datasets; these connections are subsequently used to configure structured [Data Views](https://www.dpuse.app) from the underlying sources.

**Contextualising** extracts chronological events from those [Data Views](https://www.dpuse.app) and maps them into comprehensive [Context Models](https://www.dpuse.app). This gives the DPUse Engine the structural framework needed to generate deterministic transactions, facts, or observations.

**Publishing** uses a library of [Presenters](https://www.dpuse.app) to render standard [Presentations](https://www.dpuse.app) immediately using the contextualised data; additionally, [Cookbooks](https://www.dpuse.app) of [Recipes](https://www.dpuse.app) let you build Data Apps using your preferred tools.

In addition, DPUse provides [Tools](https://www.dpuse.app) used by the application, and you can use them to construct connectors and presenters.

## Browser Support

| Browser       | Minimum | Set by                                 |
| :------------ | ------: | :------------------------------------- |
| Chrome / Edge |     123 | `field-sizing: content`                |
| Safari / iOS  |      26 | Trusted Types, `field-sizing: content` |
| Firefox       |     148 | Trusted Types                          |

[Trusted Types](https://caniuse.com/trusted-types) is a hard requirement, not a progressive enhancement. The CSP in `public/_headers` sets `require-trusted-types-for 'script'`, and `src/main.ts` installs the `default` policy that permits the blob URLs Vite's `?worker&inline` uses. That code reads the `trustedTypes` global directly, so a browser without the API throws `ReferenceError` during bootstrap and the user gets the fatal-error banner instead of the app. Chrome and Edge have had it since 83; Safari 26 and Firefox 148 are the releases that complete the picture.

[`field-sizing: content`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_field-sizing) (`src/components/ui/text/TextArea.vue`) only degrades — the textarea stops growing with its content — but it is what raises the Chrome floor from 83 to 123.

Everything else in use sits below these versions: container queries, `dvh`/`dvw` units, `<dialog>` with `showModal()`, `:has()`, `color-mix()` and `Intl.Segmenter` (Firefox 125, the highest of them). `browserslist` in `package.json` is the single source for the floor. Everything else derives from it: `build.target` in `vite.config.ts`, the `compat/compat` ESLint rule that fails the lint on a newer API, and — via `browserslist-useragent-regexp` — the user-agent check and the message `src/main.ts` shows a browser that is too old to boot. Change `browserslist` and all three follow on the next build; only the table above has to be edited by hand.

_Keep the table above in step with `browserslist`; nothing else needs touching._

## Domain Security

Infrastructure hosted on Cloudflare. Primary domain `dpuse.app`. Subdomains: `api.dpuse.app`, `auth.dpuse.app`, `engine-eu.dpuse.app`, `my.dpuse.app`, `sample-data-eu.dpuse.app`, `www.dpuse.app`.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue (Official)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Recommended Browser Setup

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):
    - [Vue.js devtools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)
    - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Chrome DevTools](http://bit.ly/object-formatters)
- Firefox:
    - [Vue.js devtools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/)
    - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Firefox DevTools](https://fxdx.dev/firefox-devtools-custom-object-formatters/)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)

```sh
# Install browsers for the first run
npx playwright install

# When testing on CI, must build the project first
npm run build

# Runs the end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
# Runs the tests only on Chromium
npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium
# Runs the tests of a specific file
npm run test:e2e -- tests/example.spec.ts
# Runs the tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e -- --debug
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Issues

- Zoom rotation issue on iOS Safari. Zoom or double click, reset, then rotate device, reset values will be lost. Only way to correct is to close and restart the app.
